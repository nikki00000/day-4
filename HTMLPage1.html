                Daniel Jacob Radcliffe was born at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, England[4] on 23 July 1989,[5] the only child of Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Jacobson)[6][7] and literary agent Alan George Radcliffe.[8] His Jewish mother was born in South Africa, traces her ancestry to Jewish immigrants from Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia,[9][10][11] and was raised in the English town of Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex.[12][13][14][15][16] His Northern Irish father was raised in a "very working-class" Protestant family in Banbridge in County Down.[17][18] In 2019, he explored both sides of his family history in the BBC genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?[19] [a] Radcliffe's parents had both acted as children.[20][21] As a casting agent, his mother was involved in BBC productions including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries.[6][7][8]

                Radcliffe was educated at three private schools for boys in London: Redcliffe School,[22] Sussex House School,[23][24] and the City of London School.[25] After the release of the first Harry Potter film, attending school proved difficult for him as some fellow pupils became hostile, though he states they were just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than acting out of jealousy.[26] As his acting career began to consume his schedule, he continued his education through on-set tutors. He has admitted to not being a very good student, considering school useless and finding the work "really difficult".[23] He achieved A grades in the three AS level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not attend university.[27][28] Part of his reasoning was he already knew he wanted to be an actor and screenwriter, and it would be difficult to have a normal college experience.[26]
